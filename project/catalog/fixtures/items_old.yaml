      power and influence, no one comes close to Zanetti''s group, the strongest force
      in Las Sombras. When Zanetti learns of a rival clan''s drug deal, he dispatches
      five of his top mercenaries from his inner circle to intervene. When they arrive
      on the scene, they find their targets have already been executed and to their
      surprise, they are ambushed by members of their own cartel. They were set up
      to appear as traitors who were out to nab the drugs and money for themselves.
      They had been double crossed, but by who? Was this some scheme by the cartel
      to exploit them as scapegoats? Did one of the five betray the others? Outnumbered
      and pursued by both their previous cartel and law enforcement officials, the
      five are forced to split up and disappear into the shadows of Las Sombras. Beat
      Down: Fists of Vengeance puts gamers in the role of one of the five fugitives
      as they seek revenge against their foes. Betrayal comes at a high price and
      to survive in Las Sombras, you need power. With enemies everywhere, the only
      hope is to find the other four and build enough power to strike back. Using
      a low-key downtown bar as a hideout base, players will wander the town in search
      of information and add allies to their growing opposition. Taking different
      jobs around town will add much needed funds to fuel the growth of the posse.
      By proving themselves in street battles, effectively utilizing negotiation skills
      and using clever disguises, they will be able to build their influence on the
      mean streets. Soon no one will stand in the way of cold hard vengeance!', game: 2156,

      The Force Unleashed completely re-imagines the scope and scale of the Force
      by taking full advantage of newly developed technologies that will be seen and
      experienced for the fi rst time: Digital Molecular Matter (DMM), by Pixelux
      Entertainment, and euphoria by NaturalMotion Ltd. Paired with the powerful Havok
      Physics system, these new technologies create gameplay only possible on the
      new generation of consoles. DMM incorporates the physical properties of anything
      in the environment so that everything reacts exactly like it should- wood breaks
      like wood, glass shatters like glass, plants on the planet Felucia bend like
      plants on the planet Felucia would, and more. Meanwhile, as a revolutionary
      behavioral-simulation engine, euphoria enables interactive characters to move,
      act and even think like actual human beings, adapting their behavior on the
      fly and resulting in a different payoff every single time.', game: 2069, name: 'Star

      any of the three titles. Not only that, but players can also earn awards by
      collecting tokens through their progress across the trilogy, making for an ideal
      award system. Both Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes games have been
      updated with the refined control system of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. Moving
      is done with the Control Stick and the Nunchuk controller, while the Wii Remote
      controller controls the Arm Cannon''s crosshairs, allowing the player to smoothly
      and more accurately aim by pointing at the screen. The camera will move where
      the player points, making for more intuitive control, and allowing players to
      look around and attack while moving. Three different sensitivity settings allow
      everyone from beginners to FPS veterans to find a response speed to their liking.
      In addition to the new control, the Nintendo GameCube games have new features
