<p>Hi {{ user.first_name|default:user.username }},</p>

<p>We're sorry to hear that <strong>{{ claim.claim_object.item }}</strong> was not received as required. 
  Unfortunately, games do get mixed-up during shipment from time to time.</p>
   
<p>Please return the following game(s) below on your account by their specified due dates to avoid 
  a replacement fee in the amount of $50.00 plus applicable taxes being charge to your account:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Date Reported</th>
    <th>Due Date</th>
    <th>Game Title</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{{ claim.date|date }}</td>
    <td>{{ claim.next_penalty_payment_date|date }}</td>
    <td>{{ claim.claim_object.item }}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Once received, the next game on your Rent List will be shipped as soon as possible. We apologize 
  for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>- The Gamemine Team</p>
