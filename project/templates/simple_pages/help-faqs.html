<h2 id="a2">Trading Games</h2>

<h3 id="a2_1">General</h3>
<ol class="decimal">
  <li id="a2_1_1"><strong>What are Gamemine Credits?</strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>The Gamemine Credit system is the tool used by Gamemine to manage and set value for trades, gift points
        for promotions, and with the reintroduction of the GamePerks Program in the coming months after release,
        Members will receive Credit from Gamemine as rewards for membership. The New Credit System is broken down
        into three categories, Pending Credits, Cashable Credits and Non-Cashable Credits and is described below.
        <ol style="list-style:decimal;">
          <li><strong class="red">Pending Credits.</strong> Pending Credits may be Non-Cashable Credits or Cashable Credits that a Rental
            Member or Registered Member receive initially from transacting trades, as part of a promotion for
            signing up for a rental subscription, and for costs expended from shipment.
            <ol style="list-style:lower-latin;">
              <li><strong class="blue">Trades.</strong> When a Registered Member or a Rental Member trades in their game in accordance with
                the requirements provided and notified during the course of each trade transaction, the Member
                will initially receive Pending Credits. Pending Credits cannot be used until the trade is accepted
                by our Distribution Center. Once the trade is accepted, the Member credit allocation will transfer
                from Pending to Cashable Credits for redemption for cash or to be used towards purchases or
                services on Gamemine.</li>
              <li><strong class="blue">Shipment.</strong> When a Member ships their game for Credits, the Member will also receive Shipping
                Credits for the cost of shipment for their game. This amount is set by GameMine and is subject to
                change and is allocated to each unit independently. Unlike those credits received from trades,
                shipping credits for shipment are transferred to the Non-Cashable Credits in your account.</li>
              <li><strong class="blue">Rent Plan.</strong> As part of promotions Gamemine offers for its rental subscription plans. Members may,
                when applicable and offered, receive additional Rental Plan Credits allocated to them as a
                promotional offering for signing up for a Rental Subscription plan. Rental Plan Credits remain pending
                until the Member's first successful billing cycle then will be transferred into Non-Cashable Credits
                to be used for purchases from Gamemine.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong class="red">Cashable Credits.</strong> When a Member trades their game with Gamemine, the Member will receive Pending Credits
            commensurate with the trade rate allocated for the particular game title.  Once the game has been received
            and approved by Gamemine, therefore accepted and inventoried by the distribution center, the Member will
            receive Cashable Credits commensurate to the amount as provide for the trade. Cashable Credits may be redeemed
            for cash value through account controls on the Member's profile. The minimum amount that can bee cashed out is
            twenty-five (25) Cashable Credits, and any amount requested to be redeemed as cash cannot exceed seventy percent
            (70%) of the total Cashable Credit allowance balance. Cashable Credits may be redeemed for purchases on the Gamemine
            website, including games and Rental Subscription plans without limitation.</li>
          <li><strong class="red">Non-Cashable Credits.</strong> Those Members who maintained <strong>“GameBucks”</strong> will
            receive Non-Cashable Credits to be used on Gamemine's website once the conversion has been completed.
            Notification will be sent updating Members regarding this conversion shortly. Non-Cashable Credits are
            those credits received from Gamemine as part of a promotional program, or as shipping credits for game
            trades, provided by Gamemine as part of its upcoming <strong>“GamePerks”</strong> Program, and from
            conversion of those credits received through purchasing Retail Credit Cards offered at retailers similar
            to gift certificates. Non-Cashable Credits may only be redeemed through purchases at Gamemine and Rental
            Subscription services. Non-Cashable Credits may be forfeited if your account fails to remain in good
            standing for a period of time as a result of cancellation, delinquency or in the event of any
            suspension of your account.</li>

  <li id="a2_1_2"><strong>How do you trade-in a game?</strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>Any eligible game can be traded-in by clicking the <strong>“Trade Icon”</strong>
        <img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/catalog/catalog-actions-trade.png" width="20" height="20"/>
        or <strong>“Trade Button”</strong>, adding the game to your trade cart and completing the checkout steps.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li id="a2_1_3"><strong>What are shipping credit reimbursements?</strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>You are responsible for mailing your trade orders with a shipping carrier of your choice and in-return,
        Gamemine will compensate you for shipping costs based on
        <a href="http://www.usps.com/prices/media-mail-prices.htm" target="_blank">USPS Media Mail Rates</a> up
        to 10% of your total trade-in value plus $1.00 for packaging. For more information on how to prepare
        a package for shipping visit the official USPS website

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li id="a2_1_4"><strong>How does the bonus trade-in credits work?</strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>From time-to-time we will give extra trade-in credit for games we indicate as <strong>“Hot Trades”</strong>.
        So, if the game you are trading in qualifies as a <strong>“Hot Trade”</strong>, you will automatically receive
        the bonus trade-in credit amount when the game is received by our Distribution Center and the game accepted under
        the trade-in <a href="{% url simple-page 'Terms' %}">eligibility terms</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li id="a2_1_5"><strong>How does receiving cash back for trade-ins work?</strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>Any credits received as a result of accepted trade-ins can be cashed out in the form of
        a <strong>“Check”</strong> of <strong>“PayPal”</strong> payment. However, cash payments are
        only worth seventy (70) cents on the dollar of the credit value of any accepted traded-in game.
        For example, a game that is worth <strong>$30.00</strong> in credit would only be worth
        <strong>$21.00</strong> in cash value.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li id="a2_1_6"><strong>What payment methods are available when receiving cash back?</strong><br /><br />

  <li id="a3_1_1"><strong>What is a Rent List?</strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>Your <strong>“Rent List”</strong> is a list of requested video games that you generate by listing all the
        video games you want to play.<br /><br />
        Please keep in mind the following when you report add games to <strong>“Rent List”</strong>:<br /><br />
	<ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
          <li>Select from a selection of thousands of games that are available to rent today!</li>
          <li>You are the creator of your own list and are able to add, delete and/or prioritize your video game titles the way you like.</li>
          <li>Keep a minimum of seven (7) games on your <strong>“Rent List”</strong> to ensure continuous shipping of
            the games you want to play.</li>

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li id="a3_1_2"><strong>How many games should I put in my Rent List?</strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>We suggest that you keep a minimum of seven (7) games on your <strong>“Rent List”</strong> in order
        to avoid delays in processing your service.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li id="a3_1_3"><strong>We put games on our Rent List. Is there anything else we need to do? </strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>No there isn't. You've done everything you need to do. Our distribution system will search for available
        titles from your <strong>“Rent List”</strong>, looking for your top priorities first. Once we've located
        the titles we ship them automatically to you. When we receive a returned game the distribution system starts
        the search for your next title all over again.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li id="a3_1_4"><strong>Can I add unreleased games to my Rent List?</strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>Yes! You may add unreleased games to your <strong>“Rent List”</strong>. Our content management team is
        continually adding the newest and upcoming releases onto our website. Once a game is released, we will add
        it to our inventory and begin shipping it out to our members.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li id="a3_1_1"><strong>Why did I receive a game not at the top of my Rent List?</strong><br /><br />
    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>Inventory levels are continuously changing. The video games that you requested might not be available at this time; therefore we shipped the next available game title from your <strong>“Rent List”</strong>. Once we find a game title that was available from your list we shipped that one immediately. Be sure to keep a minimum of seven (7) games on your <strong>“Rent List”</strong> to ensure continuous shipping of the games you want to play.<br /><br />
        If the game at the top of your priority is new, please note that demand for the newest and most popular titles can oftentimes exceed the amount of those titles we are able to stock. Our inventory process is driven by what our members want the most, so having the game at the top of your <strong>“Rent List”</strong> does let us know to increase our supply levels for that game!

        <ol style="list-style:decimal;">
          <li>Log into your account and make sure that you are <strong>“Eligible”</strong> for another game to be sent. If one of your games is still in transit back to us, we won’t be able to send you a game until it arrives at one of our facilities. Once our Distribution Center has received your game, you will be sent a <strong>"Shipped Game Notification"</strong> notification as well as it displaying within your <strong>“Rent History”</strong>.</li>
          <li>Check to make sure you have enough games on your <strong>“Rent List”</strong>. If you don’t have a minimum of seven (7) games, it may cause significant delays in our ability to get you the games you want to play.</li>
          <li>If neither of these seems to be the problem, please allow us 1 to 2 days to process your next game (especially if we just received your last game at our Distribution Center). At that point, feel free to contact us about the problem so that one of our friendly Customer Service Representatives can research the problem in order to assist you.</li>

Once we receive your game, we will ship the next available game from your Rent List.<br /><br />
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you have any outstanding games upon cancellation of your service, they must be returned to our Distribution Centers within seven (7) days of a member’s cancellation date or they will be considered <strong>“Unreturned”</strong>.

    <ol class="lower-latin">
      <li>2xSPEED was NOT discontinued with the relaunch of the Gamemine website on
        October 31, 2010, the program is now a part of our regular rental subscription service.
        Through tracking software and integration with the United States Postal Office (USPS)
        Confirm Service, we receive real time tracking of the prepaid First-Class mailers at
        the point of entry into the mail-steam. Once you take the mailer to the post office to
        return the game, the game is checked in by the Post Office, and the next available
        game on your <strong>“Rent List”</strong> is sent from your assigned Distribution Center
        expediting the process of rental rotations if a game is eligible under the terms and
        conditions of your subscribed rent plan. <br /><br />

        Please note that 2xSPEED <strong>WILL NOT</strong> be processed if one of the following occurs:

        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>i. Your mail is processed at a U.S. Postal Service facility that does not have
            scanning equipment.</li>

            operating procedures.</li>
