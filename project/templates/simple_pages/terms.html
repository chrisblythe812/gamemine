Gamemine checks that each game is in working order and playable prior to shipping to its customers, and confirms that each game returned is in working order and playable prior to restocking.</p>
<p><strong>Damaged, Lost, Unreturned Games:</strong> In the event that any game is damaged while in your possession, you are responsible for the retail value of the game(s). In the event you fail to return games on rotation sent to replace any damaged or lost game, you will be responsible for the retail value of the game, which will be charged to your credit or debit card. If the game is returned damaged, you will be responsible for the retail value of the game which will be further charged to your credit card. If we do not receive the game on a rotation for a new game, the new game will not be sent until the game has arrived, and if the game fails to arrive, you are responsible for the retail value of the game which will be charged on your credit card.</p>
<p>Upon cancellation, you are responsible for the game's return, and you hereby permit GameMine, should that particular process be in effect at GameMine's sole and absolute discretion or subjectively to your account at GameMine's sole and absolute, yet reasonable, discretion, to AUTHORIZE your registered billing information for the retail value of the game. Gamemine STRONGLY recommends that you return the games using certified mail to ensure that the game is received by Gamemine. Should the game become lost in the mail when returning the games upon cancellation, your card WILL be charged for the game(s). Therefore, again, Gamemine suggests that if you cancel, you return the games using certified mail to ensure they are received. Additionally, if the game is returned damaged on a cancellation, your card will also be charged pursuant to the cancellationpolicy.</p>
<p><strong>Lost Games on Rotation.</strong> Gamemine uses a tracking system to track the mailing of each game for subscription and purchases through third party software. You agree that this tracking does track the game from fulfillment to you and back. In the event that you did not receive your game from a rotation, meaning the return of game(s) for new game(s), you must immediately notify Gamemine. We will then, at our discretion, send you a new copy of the game. Gamemine shall at its own and absolute discretion, and with your authorization by acceptance of these terms and conditions with use of our service perform either or a combination of the following, (1) pre- authorize your credit card for a period no longer than thirty (30) days pending the receipt of the game from the post office, which you must notify Gamemine immediately and return said game and or, (2) should you cancel your membership with sixty (60) days from the submission of the replacement game to the lost game, your card at Gamemine sole and absolute discretion may be authorized and or charged for the retail value of the game missing in addition to the terms as set forth under the Cancellation policy. The reason for this action is the probability that during that time the lost game may be received. Should you receive the lost game, in any circumstance, you must contact Gamemine immediately to return the game. If your card was charged, you can return the game, and Gamemine shall remove the authorization on your card or alternatively in the case of charging your credit card, re-credit your card, less any restocking fee.</p>
<p>By signing up for the subscription service, you hereby authorize Gamemine to charge your card for the service as well as authorize your card in accordance with the terms provided herein. Additionally, you authorize Gamemine to charge the card for any purchase, cancellation or submission of any replacement game for lost or damaged games. You agree to assist Gamemine with any information necessary for Gamemine to file a missing report with USPS. In the event the lost game is received, as stated, you must notify Gamemine immediately and return the game. If Gamemine does not receive this game within ten (10) days of notification, the authorization on your card will be charged. If Gamemine determines by its investigation with the USPS that the game was delivered to your address, the authorization will be charged.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Rental List Requirements &amp; Refunds</strong> GameMine offers a rental subscription based negative option billing platform offering its rental customers access in accordance with these terms and conditions to the inventory of games held by GameMine for the rental program.

Notwithstanding, and to reiterate, the user hereby acknowledges and accepts that any requested refund is performed in the sole and absolute discretion of GameMine and not required by GameMine limiting the user to the terms set forth under the Cancellation Policy. Certain factors are considered when determining whether a customer may receive a refund, including but not limited to the following, (1) the duration of time before the refund is requested from the time of registration for the rental program, (2) does the user have a game outstanding at the time of the request or prior to the request of the refund, (3) the user has at least seven (7) games on their List for a reasonable period of time to be determined in GameMine sole and absolute, but reasonable, discretion, yet all such games included on the user's List are unavailable for the duration of time leading up to the refund; and, (8) this is the first time the user has signed up for the rental program and the first month of his or her membership. Again, the decision to offer the member a refund is not a right or arises from any terms and conditions set forth herein, rather, within the sole and absolute business discretion of GameMine.</p>

<ol class="decimal">
  <li>2xSPEED - Is a feature enabling the customer to receive their games quicker than the normal course of delivery. Whereas to receive the next game on your list, it is required that a game be returned before the next one is shipped. However, the 2xSPEED feature through partnership with USPS Confirm Service enables the ability for a user to receive the next game on their Rent List. Gamemine receives notification by and through a tracking software provided by a third party that the game is in transit within USPS for return to the distribution center. Based on that notification, the following game by preference, and subject to availability, is shipped from the assigned distribution center to the member in succession of the USPS tracking notification that the returning game is in transit to the assigned distribution center. Customer understands and acknowledges that this notification process is part of a third party service and software program integrated with the GameMine database. Accordingly, GameMine makes no representations or promises that this particular feature is guaranteed in every situation to the customer member in the event the tracking is not properly working outside GameMine's control as a result of the USPS software and or the third party software tracking systems. Finally, this tracking is contingent on the USPS processing centers maintaining the software and hardware systems for the tracking software to access the transit data. If the post office that the member uses based on their address does not have the proper software or hardware for this tracking system to record the transit data, this may cause a delay in the 2xSPEED process.</li>

<p>In addition to the above rewards, other rewards are being structured between some of Gamemine partnerships, which you will see over the next several weeks.
